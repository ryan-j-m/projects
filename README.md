# projects
This repo holds a few of my favorite projects from my undergrad at University of Washington-Seattle.

The code in this repository IS NOT properly documented and many of the graphics and computationally expensive portions have been commented out.

Check out the pdf write-ups that accompany each .ipynb to get an in depth explanation of each project.
